# MenuBarUtils
App that allows to download a youtube video by copying it's link.

This simple application (for Mac OS) is written in Python and allows user to download a youtube video by copying to clipboard a YT url, opening the MenuBar app and simply clicking "Download video from clipboard" to download the video to /usr/downloads/YoutubeDownloader.
I know that it's a simple application, and i know that my code is probably wrong, but i'm studying python on my own, and i wanted to publish my first official app :)
